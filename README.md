Why Use This Tool?
Because life's too short for inconsistent audio levels. Your viewers' ears will thank you, and you'll never have to do the volume dance again - you know, that awkward shuffle between the volume up and down buttons while binge-watching.

Why did the audio normalizer go to therapy?
It had too many ups and downs in life! üé¢
